<h2>Hobbies</h2>
<p>In addition to my technical expertise, I actively engage in various hobbies that enhance my skills and personal development. I
enjoy working on personal coding projects and contributing to open-source software, which keeps me updated with the latest 
technologies. Participating in hackathons allows me to collaborate with peers and solve complex problems under time constraints. 
I am also passionate about robotics, often building and programming robots for competitions. Outside of technology, I play chess 
to sharpen my strategic thinking and write tech blogs to share my knowledge with the community. Additionally, I volunteer to teach
coding to underprivileged students, reflecting my commitment to giving back and fostering education.</p>
